<h3>Customer Reviews</h3>

<p>"I was intimidated even by the college application process. The admissions essays were a breeze after I finished the final Composition &amp; Proofreading course. I got accepted by my first-choice and am looking forward to that first college English paper!"<br> - Ima Reddy

<br><br>

"I never knew that Literary Analysis could be so intriguing. There were a lot of great excerpts used in this course. I went and checked a few of the books out from the library! I didn't expect to <i>enjoy</i> these courses." <br> - P. Griffin

<br><br>

"The staff is very timely and courteous. I appreciate the professionalism. I am almost done with the second course. The information is very straight-forward and easy to understand. I recommend it all the time. The rebates are great, too!" <br> - Olive Greene
