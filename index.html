<h3>The harsh reality is</h3>

<p>Many Students entering college will not have the skills they need to perform at a college-level in subjects such as English, Math, and Science. <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/most-students-arent-ready-for-college-act-data-show/">In 2013, the ACT reported that only about a quarter</a> of high school graduates who took the ACT exams scored in a range which suggests they possess the skills they will need to metriculate through college (Adams, 2013).


<br><br>Often, the first day they sit down in a college English class is the first time a student receives their first multiple-page essay assignment in their entire life. <a href="http://www.teachthought.com/uncategorized/12-data-points-detailing-the-crisis-of-poor-writing-in-america/">Even high school teachers assert</a> that students find writing to be one of their most challenging tasks (TeachThought, 2012). This, especially, is why a well-structured and thorough course to prepare students for the rigors of college-level reading, writing, and comprehension is needed.

<h3>Did you know?</h3>

<p>Preparing for college, unless you are taking <a href="https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/prepare/honors-ap">Advanced Placement (AP) courses</a>, is not a goal of public high schools in post-millenial America (College Board, 2017). Students doing well in their high school courses can mistakenly feel as if they are going to have as easy a time in college as they did with their studies in grade school. 

<br><br>On the other end of that spectrum, students struggling with low grade point average (GPA) and who otherwise feel that they are having difficulty in high school do not necessarily have to expect to experience the same difficulties in college. Material covered in most public high schools often will not reflect the course of study in college. <a href="http://www.fastweb.com/college-search/articles/getting-into-college-with-bad-grades">Community college is always a great option</a> (Hoyt, 2016) and there will be plenty of writing to do there, too.
