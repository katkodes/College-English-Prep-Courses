Principles of Web Design and Technology 1 

Final Website Proposal 

Spring 2017 

The site’s topic will be selling digital course material for learning how to write college-level essays and analyzing literature. The subtopic will be general college preparation in the subjects of English and writing. The goals are to 1) persuade visitors to sign-up to the company mailing list/newsletter and 2) to convert visitors to buyers. 

The site’s intended audience are high school students and their parents/guardians. This impacts the site design in that in needs to appeal to and be functional for 15-19-year-olds as well as their parents who may be 35-65 years old. The younger audience will prefer more interactive elements and, eventually, social features being a part of the site. The parents/guardians will be older and may have vision/hearing difficulties. Both age groups would appreciate clean, concise text, formatting, and navigation to optimize usability. 

Unique content that the site will incorporate are images/illustrations, text, and data charts. Some images will be borrowed from free sources as well as quotes from data sources – all of which will be properly cited for credit.  

The site’s content may not need to be updated very often, initially. Everything to promote and sell the digital product(s) can be automated but weekly oversight may be necessary to gauge sales and conversion rates. Updates can be performed more frequently if adding a daily blog or member forum to test if it will increase conversion rate. 

 

 

 

The content will be organized so that visitors can identify the site’s title first, then a heading will address college readiness concerns for parents/students. The subheadings beneath this topic will identify & cite data collected by reputable sources about English and writing, high school/college graduation statistics, and the graduation rates/GPAs of students who took college preparation courses versus those who did not.  

The navigation bar will include links to the home page, a detailed product description page, frequently asked questions page, and the secure shopping cart. 

This site would be for a business that I create. A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate will be required to protect customer’s identity (credit card info, address, phone, etc.) during a transaction. A shopping cart can be added to the site for free using OpenCart or X-Cart.  

If the site is expanded later to include an online forum, it can be created in Google Groups and then embedded into the site. Video content can also be recorded and embedded on a page when the site evolves. If the company grows and develops an online curriculum, then adding features that would allow more interactivity and socialization would be required. Also, databases would then be needed so that paid members can login/out of the site as well as access digital content that would need to be stored. These changes would increase the amount of maintenance and updates the site would need.  

 

 

 

To make the website easier to maintain, I would label the parts of the HTML/CSS documents so that they can be easily distinguished from each other. I would also leave notes in the page documents so that items that are likely to be adjusted on a regular basis can be quickly identified. I’m not sure if I would seek out web hosting and a domain name for this site. It is a possibility. 

I’m not certain about the site layout, yet. I know that I don’t plan to use any centering of text or images. I will limit my copy to no more than two fonts and use web safe colors and fonts. I plan to include images that highlight how the product is beneficial to the target audience and that can evoke an emotional response. I intend to use visuals, copy, and a comfortable balance of white space to connect to the visitor and persuade them to buy something.
